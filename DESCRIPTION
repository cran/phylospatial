Description: Conduct various analyses on spatial phylogenetics. Use your data
    on an evolutionary tree and geographic distributions of the terminal taxa
    to compute diversity and endemism metrics, test significance with null 
    model randomization, analyze community turnover and biotic regionalization,
    and perform spatial conservation prioritizations. All functions support
    quantitative community data in addition to binary data.
